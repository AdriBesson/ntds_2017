# A Network Tour of Data Science, edition 2017

This repository contains the material for the labs associated with the EPFL
master course [EE-558 A Network Tour of Data Science][epfl] ([moodle]), taught
in autumn 2017. Compared to the [2016 edition], the course has been refocused
on graph and network sciences. The course material revolves around the
following topics:

1. [Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science),
1. [Spectral Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_graph_theory),
1. [Graph Signal Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.0053),
1. [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

[moodle]: http://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=15299
[2016 edition]: https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2016

As such, you get the following material:
1. [Practical informations][practical_info]
1. [Installation instructions](install.md)
1. Introduction to Python for Data Science
1. Network properties: demo, assignment, solution
1. Network models: demo, assignment, solution
1. Spectral graph theory: demo, assignment, solution
1. Graph signal processing: demo, assignment, solution
1. Machine learning: demo, assignment, solution

As a Data Science course, the above activities are realized on real networks,
e.g. a social network from Twitter, that students have to collect and clean.
